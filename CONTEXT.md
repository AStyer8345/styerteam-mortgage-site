## Last Worked On

2026-04-26 PM (daily-opt) — **`blog-post-header` template AEO cluster 14/14 COMPLETE.** Closed last gap: 2026-04-17-should-i-refinance-austin-tx-2026 — body `<p><strong>` (56w) added after `</header>` with distinct angle from intro (intro: 3 conditions / body: run-the-formula + Austin median tenure ~6 yrs + 30/48-month examples). All 6 H2s already in question form. dateModified + sitemap lastmod bumped to 2026-04-26. Commit 0c60b27 → live within 75s. NotebookLM Step 0 dead 6th run — diff still pending Adam's apply. AEO loose-thread audit identified next cluster: ~16 older-template dated 2026-* posts that need a different audit method (find first `<p>` after `<h1>` in `<article>`/`<main>` body). Proposed cadence: 2 posts/AM run paired by topic (cash-out+fha-vs-conv → va+ftb → dscr+how-to-choose → self-employed+next).

2026-04-25 PM (daily-opt) — Rate-shopper AEO 8/10: what-delays-closing + how-to-read-a-loan-estimate (56w + 66w). Commit de08af6.

2026-04-25 AM (daily-opt) — Footer Awards sitewide standardization (56 files; about.html timeline-date surfaced as separate Adam-decision). Rate-shopper AEO 6/10.

2026-04-24 (styer-suburb-editor-daily) — Buda page deepened.

## Active Blockers

| Issue | Priority |
|-------|----------|
| NotebookLM Step 0 broken — concrete unified-diff SKILL.md retirement patch ready in 2026-04-26 AM run log FLAG_FOR_ADAM. One-shot edit. 6th-run escalation. | HIGH (ESCALATED) |
| how-to-buy-a-house-in-austin-tx.html loan table includes USDA (`<a href="/loans/usda.html">USDA</a>`) — Adam does NOT do USDA. Needs removal. | HIGH |
| Smithville (26 hits), Elgin (24), Florence (17), Jarrell (16): body/schema/FAQ USDA — same review as Buda (now done). Liberty Hill done 2026-04-26 (commit cbddcc0, separate session). | HIGH |
| Suburb quick-form submissions not counted as Google Ads conversions — GTM dashboard config needed | HIGH |
| Blog title brand drift — recurring issue, pre-publish lint required | HIGH |
| about.html timeline-date span still has "91 Google + 45 Zillow Reviews" — different element from footer Awards. Adam decision: update or leave as historical milestone. | MEDIUM |
| thank-you.html uncommitted change in working tree — `ty-alt-paths` reveal logic for refi/preapproval thank-you-types. Not from any current scheduled task. Adam decision: commit or revert. | MEDIUM |
| PageSpeed manual check needed — quota blocks automated check | MEDIUM |
| Monday 2026-04-27 — verify GSC sitemap.xml shows "Success" + discovered pages > 0 | LOW |
| GSC URL Inspection needed — Taylor, Smithville, Elgin, Florence, Jarrell; manual Request Indexing needed | LOW |
| GTM malware flag still shows in version list — cosmetic only; new tag entity IDs are clean | LOW |

## What's Next

3. **USDA cleanup (remaining)** — Smithville, Elgin, Florence, Jarrell body/schema/FAQ + how-to-buy loan table. Liberty Hill done.
4. **about.html timeline-date** + **thank-you.html alt-paths** — both Adam decisions.
