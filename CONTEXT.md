# styerteam.com — Context

## Current State

Public site for Adam Styer, NMLS #513013. Static HTML/CSS/JS. Canonical origin is https://styerteam.com. `cleanUrls` is off, so extensionless URLs exist only as explicit 301s in `_redirects` (compiled into `vercel.json`). Production is still commit dde482e3 on `cursor/card-photo-framing-d0ca` until this branch is reviewed. Do not merge and do not deploy to production.

Forms still post to `/` and `/.netlify/functions/lead-intake`. On Vercel both copies call LoanOS. Do not rename fields or change that endpoint. Preview hosts do not send live leads unless ALLOW_PREVIEW_LIVE_LEADS=true.

GTM-PQQ6PGLR loads immediately on styerteam.com and www.styerteam.com only. Direct Google-tag events wait until `gtm.load`. `generate_lead` fires once after a confirmed capture, with form id and page path, and no contact fields.

## Last Worked On

GA4 landing-page `(not set)` and missing `generate_lead` events, plus 72 sitemap pages that 404 without `.html` (including `/asset-depletion-calculator`). Not merged and not deployed to production.

## Working Rules

- Match existing HTML/CSS. Do not add a CSS framework or npm package without approval.
- Keep GTM container id, form field names, LoanOS capture, and the lead-intake webhook.
- Do not submit real forms against production or preview. They create real leads.
- Local builds need `CONTEXT=deploy-preview` so IndexNow does not submit.
- New blog posts belong in `blog/manifest.json`, `blog.html`, and the sitemap. Realtor updates stay under `/realtor-updates/` and are also registered in the blog index.
- Do not mark a briefing ticket done unless every file for it is committed in the same session.
