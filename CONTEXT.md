## Session Rules

- Voice: short punchy sentences, conversational, raw, no fluff. HNW = warm conversational, not cold private-banking.
- Business name: "Adam Styer | Mortgage Solutions LP" — never "The Styer Team"
- Match existing HTML/CSS patterns exactly when adding pages
- TX-licensed only — never imply Adam originates outside Texas
- No USDA origination — keep removing from product surfaces as found
- Loan application link: https://mslp.my1003app.com/513013/register (anchor text only)
- Run blog title lint before publish: `grep "<title>" blog/*.html | grep -v "Adam Styer"`
