          <p>If you've been on the fence about buying in Austin, the numbers are telling a pretty clear story right now. This is the most buyer-friendly market we've seen in over a decade &mdash; and I'm not being dramatic.</p>

          <p>Let me show you what I mean.</p>

          <h2>The Numbers Don't Lie</h2>

          <p>Here's what January 2026 data is showing across the Austin-Round Rock metro:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Median sale price:</strong> $400,495 &mdash; down 2.3% year-over-year</li>
            <li><strong>Days on market:</strong> 89 days average &mdash; the highest since March 2011</li>
            <li><strong>Seller-to-buyer ratio:</strong> 128% more sellers than buyers &mdash; the largest imbalance among the top 50 U.S. metros</li>
            <li><strong>City of Austin median:</strong> $522,500 (Caldwell County as low as $237,491)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>That last stat is the one that should get your attention. When there are significantly more sellers than buyers, the leverage shifts hard in your favor. Sellers are negotiating. They're covering closing costs. They're making repairs. Some are dropping price before the first showing.</p>

          <h2>Why This Window Matters</h2>

          <p>Here's what a lot of buyers miss: this kind of leverage doesn't last forever. Austin added 51% more households over the past decade &mdash; roughly 2.5x the national growth rate. The demand engine hasn't gone away. People are still moving here.</p>

          <p>What's happening right now is a timing gap. Buyers are sitting on the sidelines waiting for rates to hit the low 5s. Meanwhile, inventory is climbing and sellers are getting antsy. That's the window.</p>

          <p>When rates eventually do come down &mdash; and they will &mdash; every one of those sidelined buyers floods back in. Prices go up. Competition returns. The window closes.</p>

          <h2>What Smart Buyers Are Doing Right Now</h2>

          <ol>
            <li><strong>Buying at today's prices with tomorrow's upside.</strong> A 2.3% price drop might not sound like much, but on a $400K home that's nearly $10,000 in your pocket compared to last year. And you're negotiating from strength.</li>
            <li><strong>Asking sellers to buy down their rate.</strong> With homes sitting 89 days on market, sellers are motivated. A 2-1 buydown paid by the seller can save you thousands in the first two years. <a href="../products.html">Learn about buydown options</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Getting pre-approved before shopping.</strong> In this market, prepared buyers get the best deals because sellers take them seriously. A pre-approval letter tells the seller you can actually close. <a href="../prequal.html">Start your pre-qualification</a>.</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

          <p>Analysts aren't predicting a crash. What they're describing is a "great reset" &mdash; a multi-year normalization where prices stabilize and affordability gradually improves. That's not doom and gloom. That's a healthy market.</p>

          <p>For buyers, the math is simple: buy now while you have leverage, lock in today's price, and refinance when rates drop. Marry the house, date the rate.</p>
