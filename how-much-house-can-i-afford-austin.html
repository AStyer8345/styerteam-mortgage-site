      <h1>How Much House Can I Afford in Austin, TX?</h1>
      <p class="hero-subtitle">A practical guide to calculating your real home buying budget — not just what you qualify for, but what you can comfortably afford in the Austin market.</p>
    </div></section>

    <section class="section"><div class="container container-narrow"><div class="article-body">

      <h2>The Difference Between Qualifying and Affording</h2>
      <p>The amount a lender approves you for and the amount you should spend are often two different numbers. Lenders use debt-to-income ratios and credit profiles to calculate your maximum loan amount, but they do not account for your personal savings goals, lifestyle preferences, or comfort level with monthly payments.</p>
      <p>The smartest approach is to understand both numbers — your maximum qualification and your comfortable budget — then shop within the range that lets you sleep well at night.</p>

      <h2>How Lenders Calculate Your Maximum</h2>
      <p>Mortgage lenders use two key ratios to determine how much you can borrow:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Front-end ratio (housing DTI):</strong> Your total housing payment (principal, interest, taxes, insurance, HOA) should not exceed 28-31% of your gross monthly income.</li>
        <li><strong>Back-end ratio (total DTI):</strong> All monthly debt payments (housing + car loans, student loans, credit cards, etc.) should not exceed 43-50% of gross monthly income, depending on the loan program.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For example, if your household earns $10,000/month gross, a lender would target a maximum housing payment of $2,800-$3,100 and maximum total debt payments of $4,300-$5,000.</p>

      <h2>Austin-Specific Costs to Factor In</h2>
      <p>Austin has some unique cost factors that affect your real affordability:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Property taxes:</strong> Texas has no state income tax, but property tax rates are higher than the national average. In Travis County, effective rates range from 1.6-2.2% depending on the taxing district. On a $450,000 home, that is $7,200-$9,900 per year ($600-$825/month).</li>
        <li><strong>Homeowners insurance:</strong> Texas insurance premiums have increased significantly in recent years. Budget $2,000-$4,000/year depending on the home's value, age, and location.</li>
        <li><strong>HOA fees:</strong> Many Austin neighborhoods have HOA fees ranging from $50-$300+ per month. Check this before falling in love with a home.</li>
        <li><strong>Homestead exemption:</strong> Texas offers a homestead exemption that reduces your taxable value by $100,000 for school district taxes. This saves roughly $1,000-$1,500/year on property taxes for your primary residence.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Quick Affordability Estimates by Income</h2>
      <p>These rough estimates assume a 30-year fixed rate, 5% down, current rates, Travis County taxes, and standard insurance. Your actual numbers may vary based on credit score, debts, and specific location.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>$75,000 household income:</strong> $250,000-$310,000 home price</li>
        <li><strong>$100,000 household income:</strong> $340,000-$420,000 home price</li>
        <li><strong>$125,000 household income:</strong> $430,000-$530,000 home price</li>
        <li><strong>$150,000 household income:</strong> $520,000-$640,000 home price</li>
        <li><strong>$200,000 household income:</strong> $700,000-$850,000 home price</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Tips to Maximize Your Buying Power</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Improve your credit score.</strong> A score of 740+ versus 680 can save you 0.5% or more on your rate, which adds thousands in buying power. Read our guide on <a href="/improve-credit-score.html">improving your credit score</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Pay down existing debt.</strong> Reducing your car payment or credit card balances directly increases your qualifying amount by improving your DTI ratio.</li>
        <li><strong>Explore down payment assistance.</strong> Texas and Austin both offer <a href="/austin-down-payment-assistance.html">DPA programs</a> that can cover part or all of your down payment, freeing up cash for closing costs or reserves.</li>
        <li><strong>Consider all loan programs.</strong> <a href="/loans/fha.html">FHA loans</a> allow higher DTI ratios (up to 56.9% in some cases). <a href="/loans/va.html">VA loans</a> have no maximum DTI guideline. <a href="/loans/usda.html">USDA loans</a> require zero down. The right program can significantly change your budget.</li>
        <li><strong>Look at the full metro.</strong> Communities like Round Rock, Pflugerville, Hutto, Kyle, and Bastrop offer lower price points with access to Austin's job market.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Comfortable Payment Rule</h2>
      <p>Many financial advisors recommend keeping your total housing payment at 25-28% of your gross income — below the lender's maximum. This leaves room for savings, retirement contributions, and unexpected expenses. In a city like Austin where property taxes and insurance are significant, this buffer is especially important.</p>
      <p>The best budget is one you will not stress about in five years, not just one that works on paper today.</p>
