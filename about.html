            <p style="font-size: 1.125rem; color: #6B7280; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
              I'm originally from Ohio—Go Bucks—but I've called Austin home for over 16 years. I loved it so much that my parents, brother, uncles, and most of my family followed me here (minus one brother who landed in Nashville). I root for the Longhorns too, as long as they're not playing Ohio State.
            </p>

            <p style="color: #6B7280; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
              Over the past decade, I've had the privilege of helping hundreds of Austin families achieve the dream of homeownership. As an independent mortgage broker, I work for you—not a big bank. I shop multiple lenders to find the best rates and terms for your specific situation, explain your options clearly, and make sure you feel confident about every decision.
            </p>

            <p style="color: #6B7280; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
              My team and I are obsessed with speed without sacrificing quality. Our average closing time is 21 days, and we pride ourselves on being responsive, proactive, and invested in your success. We don't just process loans—we build relationships.
            </p>

            <p style="color: #6B7280; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
              Outside of work, I'm a husband to my beautiful wife Britney Jo, and a dad to our three amazing kids. I'm over 10 years sober and actively involved in the sober community here in Austin. I stay focused on what matters most—faith, family, fitness, and helping people build real wealth through homeownership.
