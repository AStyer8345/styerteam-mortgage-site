          <p>One of the first decisions you will face when shopping for a mortgage is who to work with. Should you walk into your bank and ask about a home loan, or should you work with an independent mortgage broker? Both can get you to the closing table, but the experience and the outcome can look very different depending on which path you choose.</p>
          <p>As a licensed mortgage broker in Texas, I have an obvious perspective here. But I am going to give you a straight comparison so you can decide for yourself.</p>

          <h2>What Is a Mortgage Broker?</h2>
          <p>A mortgage broker is a licensed professional who acts as a middleman between you and multiple lenders. Instead of offering only one company's loan products, a broker shops your loan across a network of wholesale lenders to find the best rate and terms for your specific situation.</p>
          <p>Think of it like the difference between buying insurance directly from one company versus working with an independent insurance agent who compares quotes from a dozen carriers. The broker does not lend their own money. They originate the loan, handle the paperwork, and coordinate the process, but the funding comes from the wholesale lender they match you with.</p>
          <p>Mortgage brokers are licensed and regulated by the NMLS (Nationwide Multistate Licensing System) and must meet continuing education requirements in every state where they operate.</p>

          <h2>What Is a Bank or Direct Lender?</h2>
          <p>A bank or direct lender funds your mortgage with their own money (or money they have borrowed). When you walk into Chase, Wells Fargo, or a local credit union and apply for a mortgage, you are working with a direct lender. They offer their own loan products at their own rates, and their loan officers can only sell you what that one institution offers.</p>
          <p>Some direct lenders also include large online companies like Rocket Mortgage or Better.com. These are not banks in the traditional sense, but they function the same way: they offer only their own products at their own pricing.</p>

          <h2>Rates and Pricing</h2>
          <p>This is usually the biggest question: who gets me the better rate?</p>
          <p>A mortgage broker has access to wholesale rates from multiple lenders. These wholesale rates are often lower than the retail rates a bank offers directly to consumers, because wholesale lenders do not have to cover the overhead costs of branch locations, marketing, and large sales teams. The broker earns their compensation separately, and the total cost to the borrower is frequently lower than what a single bank offers.</p>
          <p>A bank offers one set of rates: theirs. If their pricing is not competitive on the day you lock, you have no recourse other than to start over with a different lender. With a broker, if one lender's pricing moves unfavorably, the broker can pivot to another lender without starting your application over from scratch.</p>
          <p>The bottom line: brokers can usually match or beat bank rates because they are comparing pricing across multiple lenders in real time.</p>

          <h2>Loan Options and Flexibility</h2>
          <p>Banks are limited to their own menu of loan products. If your situation does not fit neatly into their guidelines, you may be declined or pushed into a product that is not ideal for you. Some banks have strong conventional loan programs but weak FHA or VA options, or vice versa.</p>
          <p>A broker has access to dozens of lenders, each with their own set of guidelines and loan products. If one lender cannot accommodate your situation, the broker can often find another one that can, without making you start a new application. This flexibility is especially valuable for borrowers with non-traditional income (self-employed, 1099, commission-based), lower credit scores, or unique property types.</p>
          <p>For example, I regularly work with borrowers who were turned down by a bank but qualified with one of my wholesale lenders that has more flexible guidelines for the same loan type.</p>

          <h2>Service and Communication</h2>
          <p>At a large bank, your loan may be processed by a team you never meet. You might work with one person during the application, another during underwriting, and a third at closing. Turnover at big lenders is high, and your loan is one of hundreds being processed simultaneously.</p>
          <p>With a mortgage broker, you typically work directly with the broker (or a small team) throughout the entire process. You have a direct line to someone who knows your file inside and out. When an issue comes up, you get a call from a person who actually understands your situation, not a generic status update from an automated system.</p>
          <p>This is one of the reasons my clients and realtor partners consistently mention communication as the thing that sets our process apart. When you call or text, you get a real answer from someone who knows your deal.</p>

          <h2>Closing Speed</h2>
          <p>Big banks are not known for fast closings. Their volume is enormous, their processes are rigid, and delays are common. It is not unusual for a bank loan to take 45 to 60 days to close.</p>
          <p>Brokers working with nimble wholesale lenders can often close faster. Many of our transactions close in 21 to 30 days, and we have closed in as few as 14 days when needed. Speed matters in a competitive market like Austin, where sellers may favor offers with shorter closing timelines.</p>

          <h2>When a Bank Might Be the Right Choice</h2>
          <p>There are a few situations where going directly to a bank could make sense:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>You have an existing banking relationship</strong> that qualifies you for a rate discount or closing cost credit. Some banks offer perks to customers who hold significant deposits or investment accounts with them.</li>
            <li><strong>You need a niche product</strong> that is only available through a specific institution, such as a portfolio loan for a non-standard property or a physician loan with unique terms from a particular bank.</li>
            <li><strong>You prefer a large-brand name</strong> and the sense of security that comes with it, even if the rate and service may not be the most competitive.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>When a Broker Is the Better Fit</h2>
          <p>For most borrowers, a mortgage broker offers clear advantages:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>You want the best rate.</strong> Access to multiple lenders means more competitive pricing.</li>
            <li><strong>You have a unique financial situation.</strong> Self-employed, lower credit, higher debt-to-income, or non-traditional documentation borrowers benefit from a broker's access to varied guidelines.</li>
            <li><strong>You value personal service.</strong> Working with someone who knows your name, answers the phone, and advocates for you throughout the process.</li>
            <li><strong>You need to close quickly.</strong> Brokers paired with efficient wholesale lenders can outpace big bank timelines significantly.</li>
            <li><strong>You are buying in a competitive market.</strong> Faster pre-approvals and closings make your offer stronger in markets like Austin.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
          <p>I will not pretend to be unbiased here. I am a mortgage broker because I genuinely believe it is a better model for most borrowers. Shopping multiple lenders, offering competitive wholesale rates, providing hands-on personal service, and closing faster is a combination that is hard for any single bank to match.</p>
          <p>That said, the most important thing is working with someone you trust, someone who explains your options clearly, communicates throughout the process, and delivers on their commitments. Whether that person works at a bank or a brokerage, find someone who does the job well.</p>
          <p>If you want to see what a broker can do for you, <a href="contact.html">reach out anytime</a>. I am happy to run the numbers, compare options, and let the results speak for themselves.</p>
