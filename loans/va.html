      <h2>What Is a VA Loan?</h2>
      <p>A VA loan is a mortgage guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, available exclusively to active-duty service members, veterans, and eligible surviving spouses. VA loans are widely considered the best mortgage program in the country, offering benefits that no other loan type can match: zero down payment, no private mortgage insurance, no prepayment penalties, and consistently lower interest rates than conventional or FHA financing.</p>
      <p>Austin is home to a growing military-connected community, with proximity to Fort Cavazos (formerly Fort Hood) and numerous veteran-owned businesses. Whether you are transitioning out of the military, relocating to Austin for a new career, or an established veteran looking to upgrade, a VA loan gives you maximum buying power with minimum out-of-pocket costs.</p>

      <h3>VA Loan Advantages at a Glance</h3>
      <ul class="feature-list">
        <li><strong>Zero down payment</strong> — 100% financing on any home up to the appraised value</li>
        <li><strong>No PMI</strong> — saves $150-400+/month compared to conventional loans with less than 20% down</li>
        <li><strong>Lowest rates</strong> — VA rates are typically 0.25-0.50% lower than conventional rates</li>
        <li><strong>No prepayment penalty</strong> — pay off or refinance your loan anytime</li>
        <li><strong>Flexible credit</strong> — no minimum credit score required by the VA (lenders set their own, typically 580-620)</li>
        <li><strong>Reusable benefit</strong> — use your VA loan benefit multiple times throughout your life</li>
        <li><strong>Assumable</strong> — a future buyer can take over your VA loan at your locked-in rate</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The VA funding fee is a one-time charge that helps sustain the VA loan program. It replaces what would otherwise be monthly mortgage insurance. The fee varies based on your service type, down payment, and whether this is your first VA loan use:</p>
