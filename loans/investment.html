      {"@type": "Question", "name": "Can I finance a short-term rental or Airbnb property in Austin?", "acceptedAnswer": {"@type": "Answer", "text": "Yes, though Austin has specific short-term rental regulations. From a financing perspective, DSCR loans can use projected short-term rental income from platforms like AirDNA. Conventional loans treat the property as a standard investment property. Be sure to verify the property's STR eligibility under Austin's licensing requirements before purchasing."}}

      <h2>Financing for Austin Real Estate Investors</h2>
      <p>Austin's strong population growth, robust job market, and landlord-friendly Texas laws make it one of the top real estate investment markets in the country. Whether you are buying your first rental property or expanding a multi-property portfolio, the right financing strategy can significantly impact your returns.</p>
      <p>Investment property loans differ from primary residence mortgages in several important ways: higher down payments, stricter reserve requirements, and slightly higher rates. However, multiple loan programs exist to fit different investor profiles — from traditional W-2 earners buying a first rental to seasoned investors qualifying on rental cash flow alone.</p>

      <h3>Why Austin for Investment Property?</h3>
      <p>Austin consistently ranks among the nation's top metros for rental demand. The University of Texas, Dell, Apple, Tesla, Samsung, and the broader tech corridor drive strong tenant demand across every price point. Neighborhoods like East Austin, South Congress, Mueller, Windsor Park, and the suburban communities of Round Rock, Cedar Park, and Pflugerville offer diverse investment opportunities from starter rentals to luxury properties.</p>

      <div class="grid grid-2">
        <div class="feature-item">
          <h4>Conventional Investment</h4>
          <p>Traditional financing for 1-4 unit investment properties. 15-25% down, competitive rates, and up to 10 financed properties. Uses personal income, tax returns, and 75% of rental income to qualify.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-item">
          <h4>DSCR Loans</h4>
          <p>Qualify based on the property's rental income — not your personal income. No tax returns, no employment verification. Ideal for self-employed investors and portfolio builders. Minimum 1.0x DSCR required.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-item">
          <h4>Portfolio / Bank Statement</h4>

          <h4>Multi-Family (2-4 Units)</h4>
          <p>Finance duplexes, triplexes, and fourplexes. If you live in one unit, you can use <a href="/loans/fha.html">FHA</a> or <a href="/loans/va.html">VA</a> financing with as little as 0-3.5% down — a powerful house-hacking strategy.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-item">
          <h4>Short-Term Rental / Airbnb</h4>
          <p>Specialized DSCR programs that use projected short-term rental income (via AirDNA or comparable analysis) to qualify. Available for properties in STR-eligible Austin zones.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-item">
          <h4>Jumbo Investment</h4>
          <p>For high-value rental properties above $832,750. <a href="/loans/jumbo.html">Jumbo</a> investment loans typically require 25-30% down and 12-18 months of reserves.</p>

      <h2>Investment Property Loan Requirements</h2>
      <h3>Down Payment</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Single-family rental:</strong> 15-20% down (conventional) or 20-25% (DSCR)</li>
        <li><strong>2-4 unit property:</strong> 20-25% down</li>
        <li><strong>House hack (owner-occupied multi-family):</strong> 0-3.5% down with FHA/VA</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Credit Score</h3>
      <p>Conventional investment loans require 680+ (best rates at 740+). DSCR programs typically require 660-700+. Portfolio lenders may work with scores as low as 620.</p>

      <h3>Reserves</h3>
      <p>Expect to show 6 months of mortgage payments (PITIA) in liquid reserves for each financed property. For investors with 5+ properties, 6-12 months of total reserves across all properties is common.</p>

      <h3>Debt-to-Income (Conventional)</h3>
      <p>Standard DTI limit of 45-50% for conventional investment loans. 75% of rental income from subject property and existing rentals counts toward qualifying income. DSCR loans bypass DTI entirely — they only evaluate the subject property's cash flow.</p>

      <h3>DSCR Calculation</h3>
      <p>Debt Service Coverage Ratio = Monthly Rental Income &divide; Monthly Mortgage Payment (PITIA). A DSCR of 1.25 means rent exceeds the payment by 25%. Most DSCR programs require a minimum ratio of 1.0-1.25. Use our <a href="/calculators.html">mortgage calculator</a> to estimate your payment and compare it to market rents.</p>
