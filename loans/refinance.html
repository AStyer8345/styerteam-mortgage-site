For a cash-out refinance, you typically need at least 20% equity (80% LTV) for conventional loans. FHA cash-out allows up to 80% LTV, and VA cash-out allows up to 100% LTV for eligible veterans. Austin's strong home value appreciation means many homeowners have built significant equity."}},

Conventional cash-out is limited to 80% LTV. On a home worth $500,000 with a $300,000 balance, you could access up to $100,000 in cash. Funds can be used for home improvements, debt consolidation, investment, education, or any purpose."}},

Key requirements: maximum 80% LTV, 12-day waiting period from application to closing, 3-day right of rescission, and homestead properties only. You cannot close a Texas cash-out at a title company — it must be at the lender's office, attorney's office, or title company office. These rules protect Texas homeowners but require a lender experienced with Texas-specific compliance."}},

Texas cash-out refinances have a mandatory 12-day waiting period plus 3-day rescission period, so they take at least 15 days minimum."}}

      <h2>Why Refinance in Austin?</h2>
      <p>Austin homeowners have built substantial equity as home values have appreciated significantly over the past decade. Whether you want to lower your monthly payment, pay off your home faster, remove mortgage insurance, or access cash for renovations or other goals, refinancing can be a powerful financial tool.</p>
      <p>The right time to refinance depends on your current rate, how long you plan to stay in the home, and your financial goals. A rate reduction of just 0.5% on a $400,000 loan saves over $100/month and $36,000+ over the life of the loan.</p>

      <h3>Texas Cash-Out Rules</h3>
      <p>Texas has unique constitutional protections for homestead cash-out refinances under Section 50(a)(6). These include a maximum 80% loan-to-value, mandatory waiting periods, and specific closing requirements. Working with a lender experienced in Texas-specific compliance is essential to avoid delays.</p>

      <h2 class="text-center mb-3xl">Refinance Options</h2>
      <div class="grid grid-2">
        <div class="feature-item">
          <h4>Rate-and-Term Refinance</h4>
          <p>Replace your current mortgage with a new one at a lower rate or different term. No cash out. Ideal for reducing your payment, switching from ARM to fixed, or shortening from 30 to 15 years.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-item">
          <h4>Cash-Out Refinance</h4>
          <p>Tap your home equity by refinancing for more than you owe. Use funds for home improvements, debt consolidation, investments, or any purpose. <a href="/loans/conventional.html">Conventional</a> allows up to 80% LTV; <a href="/loans/va.html">VA</a> allows up to 100% LTV.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-item">
          <h4>FHA Streamline Refinance</h4>
          <p>If you have an existing <a href="/loans/fha.html">FHA loan</a>, streamline refinancing requires minimal documentation — often no appraisal, no income verification, and reduced closing costs. Fast closings in as little as 15-21 days.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-item">
          <h4>VA IRRRL (Interest Rate Reduction)</h4>
          <p>Veterans with existing <a href="/loans/va.html">VA loans</a> can use the IRRRL program for simplified refinancing. No appraisal required, minimal documentation, and the funding fee is only 0.5%. One of the fastest, cheapest refinance programs available.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-item">
          <h4>Jumbo Refinance</h4>
          <p>Refinance a <a href="/loans/jumbo.html">jumbo mortgage</a> above $832,750. Portfolio and agency jumbo programs offer competitive rates for high-value properties in Westlake, Barton Creek, and other Austin luxury neighborhoods.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-item">
          <h4>PMI Removal Refinance</h4>
          <p>If your home has appreciated and you now have 20%+ equity, refinancing can eliminate private mortgage insurance — saving $100-300+ per month even without a significant rate change.</p>
        </div>

    <section><div class="container content-narrow">
      <h2>Refinance Requirements</h2>
      <h3>Equity / Loan-to-Value</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Rate-and-term:</strong> 3-5% equity minimum (95-97% LTV)</li>
        <li><strong>Cash-out (conventional):</strong> 20% equity minimum (80% LTV)</li>
        <li><strong>Cash-out (VA):</strong> Up to 100% LTV for eligible veterans</li>
        <li><strong>Cash-out (FHA):</strong> 20% equity minimum (80% LTV)</li>
        <li><strong>Texas cash-out (50(a)(6)):</strong> 80% LTV maximum (constitutional limit)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Credit Score</h3>
      <p>Conventional refinance requires 620+ (best rates at 740+). FHA Streamline and VA IRRRL have more lenient requirements, often accepting current payment history as the primary qualifier.</p>

      <h3>Seasoning Requirements</h3>
      <p>Most refinance programs require your current mortgage to be at least 6-12 months old. FHA Streamline requires 210 days since closing and 6 payments made. VA IRRRL requires 210 days since the first payment.</p>

      <h3>Break-Even Analysis</h3>
      <p>Before refinancing, calculate your break-even point: closing costs divided by monthly savings. If closing costs are $6,000 and you save $200/month, break-even is 30 months. If you plan to stay in the home longer than that, refinancing makes financial sense. Use our <a href="/calculators.html">mortgage calculator</a> to run the numbers.</p>

      <h3>Texas 50(a)(6) Cash-Out Requirements</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Maximum 80% LTV (constitutional cap)</li>
        <li>12-day waiting period from application to closing</li>
        <li>3-day right of rescission after closing</li>
        <li>Homestead properties only (primary residence)</li>
        <li>One cash-out refinance per 12-month period</li>
        <li>Closing must occur at lender, attorney, or title company office</li>
      </ul>
