      <h2>What Is a Jumbo Loan?</h2>
      <p>A jumbo loan is a mortgage that exceeds the conforming loan limit set by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). In Travis County (Austin), the 2025 conforming limit is $832,750. Any loan above that amount is classified as a jumbo loan and cannot be purchased by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.</p>
      <p>Because jumbo loans are not backed by government-sponsored enterprises, they are held on the lender's own books (portfolio loans) or sold to private investors. This means qualification requirements are stricter, but it also means more flexibility in underwriting for borrowers with complex financial profiles — high-net-worth individuals, business owners, and professionals with significant assets.</p>

      <h3>Austin's Luxury Market</h3>
      <p>Austin's premium neighborhoods — Westlake Hills, Barton Creek, Tarrytown, Rob Roy, Cat Mountain, Spanish Oaks, and the lakefront communities around Lake Austin and Lake Travis — frequently feature homes above the conforming limit. With the median price in these areas often exceeding $1.5M, jumbo financing is essential for buyers in Austin's upper market.</p>

        <div class="feature-item">
          <h4>Fixed-Rate Jumbo</h4>
          <p>Lock in a rate for 15, 20, 25, or 30 years. Ideal for buyers planning to stay long-term. Rates are competitive with conforming loans for well-qualified borrowers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-item">
          <h4>Adjustable-Rate (ARM) Jumbo</h4>
          <p>5/1, 7/1, and 10/1 ARM options offer lower initial rates for buyers who plan to sell or refinance within 5-10 years. Popular with executives and relocating professionals.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-item">
          <h4>Interest-Only Jumbo</h4>
          <p>Pay only interest for the first 5-10 years, maximizing cash flow. Principal payments begin after the IO period. Ideal for high-income borrowers and <a href="/loans/investment.html">investors</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-item">
          <h4>Portfolio / Non-QM Jumbo</h4>

      <h2>Jumbo Loan Requirements</h2>
      <h3>Credit Score</h3>
      <p>Most jumbo programs require a minimum credit score of 700, with the best pricing at 740+. Some portfolio options are available down to 680 with compensating factors.</p>
      <h3>Down Payment</h3>
      <p>15-20% is standard for jumbo loans. Some programs offer 10% down for loan amounts up to $1.5M. Higher loan amounts may require 20-25% or more. For <a href="/loans/investment.html">investment properties</a>, expect 25-30% down.</p>
      <h3>Reserves</h3>
      <p>Jumbo lenders typically require 6-18 months of mortgage payments in liquid assets (cash, stocks, retirement accounts). Higher loan amounts and investment properties require more reserves.</p>
      <h3>Debt-to-Income Ratio</h3>
      <p>Most jumbo programs cap DTI at 43%, though portfolio lenders may flex to 50% with strong compensating factors like high reserves, significant assets, or a large down payment.</p>
