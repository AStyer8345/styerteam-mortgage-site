      <h2>What Is a USDA Loan?</h2>
      <p>USDA loans are government-backed mortgages guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture through the Rural Development program. They are designed to promote homeownership in rural and suburban communities by offering zero down payment financing to moderate-income buyers.</p>
      <p>Despite the name, USDA-eligible areas are not limited to farmland. Many growing communities near Austin — including popular towns like Bastrop, Wimberley, Liberty Hill, and Marble Falls — fall within USDA boundaries. If you work in Austin but want affordable housing outside city limits, a USDA loan could be your best financing option.</p>

      <h3>USDA-Eligible Areas Near Austin</h3>
      <p>Several counties and communities surrounding Austin qualify for USDA financing:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Bastrop County</strong> — Bastrop, Elgin, Smithville, Cedar Creek</li>
        <li><strong>Caldwell County</strong> — Lockhart, Luling, Martindale</li>
        <li><strong>Hays County (rural areas)</strong> — Wimberley, Dripping Springs (some areas), Buda outskirts</li>
        <li><strong>Williamson County (rural areas)</strong> — Taylor, Granger, Florence, Bartlett, Liberty Hill (some areas)</li>
        <li><strong>Burnet County</strong> — Marble Falls, Burnet, Bertram</li>
        <li><strong>Blanco County</strong> — Johnson City, Blanco</li>
        <li><strong>Lee County</strong> — Giddings, Lexington</li>
      </ul>
      <p>USDA eligibility changes periodically. <a href="/contact.html">Contact us</a> for a free address eligibility check before you start house hunting.</p>

      <h2 class="text-center mb-3xl">USDA Loan Benefits</h2>
      <div class="grid grid-2">
        <div class="feature-item">
          <h4>Zero Down Payment</h4>
          <p>True 100% financing — no down payment required. One of only two loan programs (along with <a href="/loans/va.html">VA loans</a>) offering zero-down options.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-item">
          <h4>Low Mortgage Insurance</h4>
          <p>Just 1.0% upfront guarantee fee and 0.35% annual fee — significantly lower than <a href="/loans/fha.html">FHA mortgage insurance</a> (1.75% upfront, 0.55% annual).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-item">
          <h4>Competitive Interest Rates</h4>
          <p>USDA rates are typically among the lowest available, often matching or beating conventional loan rates thanks to the government guarantee.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-item">
          <h4>Flexible Credit Requirements</h4>
          <p>Minimum credit score of 640 for automated approval. Manual underwriting available for scores as low as 580 with compensating factors.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-item">
          <h4>Seller Concessions Allowed</h4>
          <p>Sellers can contribute up to 6% of the purchase price toward your closing costs, reducing the cash you need to close.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-item">
          <h4>Finance Closing Costs</h4>
          <p>If the appraised value exceeds the purchase price, you can roll closing costs into the loan — potentially making it a true zero-cash-to-close mortgage.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div></section>

    <section><div class="container content-narrow">
      <h2>USDA Loan Requirements</h2>
      <h3>Income Limits</h3>
      <p>USDA loans are income-restricted. Your total household income (all adults in the home, not just borrowers) cannot exceed 115% of the area median income. For most counties near Austin, the 2025 limits are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1-4 person household:</strong> $112,450</li>
        <li><strong>5-8 person household:</strong> $148,450</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Certain deductions (childcare costs, dependents, elderly household members) can reduce your qualifying income below the limit.</p>

      <h3>Property Eligibility</h3>
      <p>The property must be located in a USDA-designated rural area, used as your primary residence, and meet minimum property standards. Condos, townhomes, single-family homes, and manufactured homes on permanent foundations all qualify.</p>

      <h3>Credit Score</h3>
      <p>A 640 credit score qualifies for automated underwriting (GUS — the USDA's approval system). Scores between 580-639 may qualify through manual underwriting with compensating factors like low DTI, stable employment, or savings reserves.</p>

      <h3>Debt-to-Income Ratio</h3>
      <p>Standard USDA DTI limits are 29% for housing costs and 41% for total debt. With strong compensating factors, the total DTI can flex up to 44% through automated approval.</p>

      <h3>USDA Guarantee Fee</h3>
      <p>USDA charges two fees instead of traditional PMI:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Upfront guarantee fee:</strong> 1.0% of the loan amount (can be financed into the loan)</li>
        <li><strong>Annual fee:</strong> 0.35% of the remaining balance (paid monthly)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>On a $250,000 loan, the annual fee adds approximately $73/month — about $50 less than FHA mortgage insurance on the same amount.</p>
