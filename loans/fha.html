        <h2>What Is an FHA Loan?</h2>
        <p>An FHA loan is a government-backed mortgage insured by the Federal Housing Administration. Created to make homeownership accessible to more Americans, FHA loans feature lower down payment requirements, more flexible credit guidelines, and competitive interest rates. They are one of the most popular loan programs for first-time homebuyers in Austin.</p>
        <p>Because the government insures the loan against default, lenders can offer more favorable terms to borrowers who might not qualify for a <a href="/loans/conventional.html">conventional loan</a>. This makes FHA financing particularly valuable in Austin's competitive housing market, where getting into a home quickly can mean the difference between winning and losing an offer.</p>

        <h3>Who Should Consider an FHA Loan?</h3>
        <p>FHA loans are ideal if you are a first-time buyer with limited savings, have a credit score between 580-619 (below conventional minimums), are recovering from a past credit event like bankruptcy or foreclosure, or want to use gift funds for your entire down payment. If you have excellent credit (720+) and 5% or more to put down, a <a href="/loans/conventional.html">conventional loan</a> may offer better terms.</p>

        <h2 class="text-center mb-3xl">FHA Loan Benefits</h2>
        <div class="grid grid-2">
          <div class="feature-item">
            <h4>3.5% Down Payment</h4>
            <p>On a $400,000 Austin home, that is just $14,000 down. Compare that to 20% ($80,000) for a conventional loan without PMI. Gift funds can cover the entire down payment.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-item">
            <h4>Credit Scores from 580</h4>
            <p>FHA accepts credit scores as low as 580 for the 3.5% down option. Scores of 500-579 can qualify with 10% down. This opens doors for buyers still building their credit.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-item">
            <h4>Flexible Debt Ratios</h4>
            <p>FHA allows debt-to-income ratios up to 50% with compensating factors, compared to 45% for most conventional programs. More of your income can go toward your mortgage payment.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-item">
            <h4>Seller Concessions up to 6%</h4>
            <p>Sellers can contribute up to 6% of the purchase price toward your closing costs, compared to 3% on conventional loans. This can save thousands at closing.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-item">
            <h4>Assumable Loans</h4>
            <p>FHA loans are assumable, meaning a future buyer could take over your mortgage at your locked-in rate. In a rising-rate environment, this can be a major selling advantage.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-item">
            <h4>Down Payment Assistance Compatible</h4>
            <p>FHA loans work with <a href="/products.html#texas">Texas DPA programs</a> like TDHCA and local Austin-Travis County assistance, potentially covering your entire down payment and closing costs.</p>

        <h2>FHA Loan Requirements in Austin</h2>

        <h3>Credit &amp; Income</h3>
        <p>Minimum 580 credit score for 3.5% down; 500-579 requires 10% down. Two years of steady employment history is standard. FHA is forgiving of past credit events: you may qualify just 2 years after a bankruptcy and 3 years after a foreclosure.</p>

        <h3>Property Requirements</h3>
        <p>The property must be your primary residence (no investment or vacation homes). It must meet FHA minimum property standards, which means the home needs to be safe, sound, and secure. The appraiser checks for health and safety issues like peeling paint, broken handrails, and structural problems.</p>

        <h3>FHA Mortgage Insurance (MIP)</h3>
        <p>FHA loans require mortgage insurance regardless of down payment amount:</p>
        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li><strong>Upfront MIP:</strong> 1.75% of the loan amount, typically financed into the loan</li>
          <li><strong>Annual MIP:</strong> 0.55% for most borrowers, paid monthly (about $183/month on a $400,000 loan)</li>
          <li>MIP remains for the life of the loan on most FHA mortgages</li>
          <li>You can refinance into a <a href="/loans/conventional.html">conventional loan</a> to remove MIP once you reach 20% equity</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2025 FHA Loan Limits for Austin</h3>
        <p>The FHA loan limit for Travis County is $524,225 for a single-family home. For multi-unit properties: $671,200 (duplex), $811,275 (triplex), and $1,008,300 (fourplex). If you need more than the FHA limit, consider a <a href="/loans/conventional.html">conventional</a> or <a href="/loans/jumbo.html">jumbo loan</a>.</p>
