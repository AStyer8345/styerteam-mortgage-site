    <!-- OVERVIEW -->
    <section>
      <div class="container content-narrow">
        <h2>What Is a Conventional Loan?</h2>
        <p>A conventional loan is a mortgage that is not insured or guaranteed by a government agency like the FHA, VA, or USDA. Instead, conventional loans are backed by private lenders and follow guidelines set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two government-sponsored enterprises that purchase mortgages from lenders.</p>
        <p>Conventional loans are the most common type of mortgage in the United States, accounting for roughly 80% of all home loans originated. In Austin's competitive real estate market, conventional financing is often preferred by sellers because it signals a well-qualified buyer and typically offers faster, smoother closings.</p>

        <h3>Why Austin Buyers Choose Conventional Loans</h3>
        <p>With Austin's median home price hovering around $450,000 and a market that rewards strong, clean offers, conventional loans give buyers a distinct advantage. The flexibility of conventional financing allows for various property types, competitive terms, and the ability to remove private mortgage insurance once you reach 20% equity.</p>

    <!-- KEY FEATURES -->
    <section class="bg-light">
      <div class="container">
        <h2 class="text-center mb-3xl">Conventional Loan Features</h2>
        <div class="grid grid-2">
          <div class="feature-item">
            <h4>Down Payment Options</h4>
            <p>Put as little as 3% down with Conventional 97 or HomeReady programs for first-time buyers. Standard options include 5%, 10%, 15%, or 20% down. Putting 20% down eliminates PMI entirely.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-item">
            <h4>Competitive Interest Rates</h4>
            <p>Conventional loans typically offer the lowest rates for well-qualified borrowers. Fixed rates available for 15, 20, 25, and 30-year terms. Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) are also available for even lower initial rates.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-item">
            <h4>Flexible Property Types</h4>
            <p>Finance single-family homes, condos, townhomes, planned unit developments, and multi-unit properties (2-4 units). Primary residences, second homes, and investment properties are all eligible.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-item">
            <h4>Removable Mortgage Insurance</h4>
            <p>Unlike FHA loans where mortgage insurance lasts the life of the loan, conventional PMI can be removed once you reach 20% equity. This can save you hundreds of dollars per month over time.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-item">
            <h4>Higher Loan Limits</h4>
            <p>The 2025 conforming loan limit for Travis County is $832,750. This covers the vast majority of Austin homes. For higher amounts, jumbo loan options are available.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-item">
            <h4>Fast Closings</h4>
            <p>Conventional loans have fewer bureaucratic requirements than government-backed loans, which means faster processing. We routinely close in 30 days, and can expedite to 21 days when your offer needs it.</p>

    <section>
      <div class="container content-narrow">
        <h2>Conventional Loan Requirements</h2>
        <p>Meeting conventional loan requirements is straightforward for most Austin homebuyers. Here is what lenders look for:</p>

        <h3>Credit Score</h3>
        <p>A minimum credit score of 620 is required for most conventional programs. Scores of 740+ receive the best rates and terms. Borrowers between 620-739 can still qualify but may face higher rates or PMI costs. Need to improve your score? Check out our <a href="/improve-credit-score.html">credit improvement guide</a>.</p>

        <h3>Debt-to-Income Ratio</h3>
        <p>Your total monthly debt payments (including the new mortgage) should not exceed 45% of your gross monthly income. Some programs allow up to 50% with strong compensating factors like high credit scores or large reserves.</p>

        <h3>Employment &amp; Income</h3>
        <p>Lenders typically require two years of consistent employment history and verifiable income through W-2s, tax returns, or pay stubs. Self-employed borrowers need two years of tax returns showing stable or increasing income.</p>

        <h3>Down Payment &amp; Reserves</h3>
        <p>While 3% down is the minimum, your down payment source matters. Savings, gifts from family, employer assistance programs, and <a href="/products.html#texas">Texas down payment assistance programs</a> are all acceptable sources. Lenders may also require 2-6 months of reserves (mortgage payments saved in accessible accounts).</p>
