      <h2>How Construction Loans Work</h2>
      <p>Building a custom home requires specialized financing. Unlike a standard mortgage that funds a completed property, a construction loan releases funds in stages — called draws — as your builder completes milestones like the foundation, framing, roofing, and interior finishes.</p>
      <p>During the construction phase (typically 8-14 months), you make interest-only payments on the amount that has been drawn. Once construction is complete, the loan either converts automatically to a permanent mortgage (one-time close) or you close on a separate permanent loan (two-time close).</p>

      <h3>Building in Austin</h3>
      <p>Austin and its surrounding communities offer outstanding options for custom home construction. From Hill Country acreage in Dripping Springs, Bee Cave, and Spicewood to established neighborhoods in Westlake, Lakeway, and Georgetown, there are build sites for every vision and budget. The region's custom home builders range from production builders to full-custom architects building one-of-a-kind homes.</p>

      <h2 class="text-center mb-3xl">Construction Loan Options</h2>
      <div class="grid grid-2">
        <div class="feature-item">
          <h4>One-Time Close (OTC)</h4>
          <p>The most popular option. One application, one closing, one set of fees. Your rate locks before construction begins, and the loan automatically converts to a permanent 15 or 30-year mortgage when building is done.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-item">
          <h4>Two-Time Close</h4>
          <p>Separate closings for construction and permanent financing. More flexibility to shop rates at completion, but two sets of closing costs. Can make sense if you expect rates to drop during the build.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-item">
          <h4>FHA Construction (OTC)</h4>
          <p>Build with just 3.5% down using an <a href="/loans/fha.html">FHA</a> one-time close construction loan. Lower credit requirements (640+) and the down payment can be based on the lower of lot + construction cost or appraised value.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-item">
          <h4>VA Construction (OTC)</h4>
          <p>Eligible veterans can build with 0% down using a <a href="/loans/va.html">VA</a> one-time close construction loan. No mortgage insurance. The builder must be VA-approved or meet lender requirements.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-item">
          <h4>Lot / Land Loans</h4>
          <p>Finance the purchase of a building lot before you are ready to build. Typically 20-30% down with terms of 5-15 years. Lot equity applies toward your construction loan down payment when you are ready to build.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-item">
          <h4>Renovation / Rehab</h4>
          <p>For major renovations that approach new construction scope. FHA 203(k), conventional HomeStyle, and portfolio renovation loans fund both the purchase and the renovation in a single loan.</p>

      <h2>Construction Loan Requirements</h2>
      <h3>Down Payment</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Conventional OTC:</strong> 10-20% of total project cost (land + construction)</li>
        <li><strong>FHA OTC:</strong> 3.5% down</li>
        <li><strong>VA OTC:</strong> 0% down for eligible veterans</li>
        <li><strong>Lot loan:</strong> 20-30% down</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you already own the lot, your equity typically counts toward the down payment requirement.</p>

      <h3>Credit Score</h3>
      <p>Conventional construction loans require 680+ (best rates at 720+). FHA construction loans start at 640. VA construction loans typically require 620-640+.</p>

      <h3>Builder Requirements</h3>
      <p>Your builder must be a licensed general contractor with a minimum 2-3 years of experience, appropriate liability and builder's risk insurance, and a track record of completed projects. The lender will review the builder's credentials, financial stability, and project portfolio.</p>

      <h3>Plans and Specs</h3>
      <p>Complete architectural plans, specifications, and a detailed line-item budget are required before closing. The lender's appraiser will value the completed project based on these plans and comparable sales.</p>

      <h3>Construction Timeline</h3>
      <p>Standard construction periods are 12 months, with 6-month extensions available. Interest-only payments are based on the drawn amount, so your payments start small and increase as construction progresses.</p>
