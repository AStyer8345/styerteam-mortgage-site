                    Your monthly payment typically includes: (1) Principal & Interest - the loan payment itself, (2) Property Tax - your local tax based on assessed value, (3) Homeowners Insurance - required protection on the home, (4) PMI - mortgage insurance if your down payment is less than 20%, and sometimes (5) HOA fees in some neighborhoods. This is often referred to as PITI + PMI.

                    Interest rates change daily based on economic factors, Federal Reserve policy, and market conditions. A "good" rate depends on your credit score, loan type, loan term, and down payment. Someone with a 780 credit score will get a better rate than someone with a 650 score. Call Adam at (512) 956-6010 for current Austin rates based on your profile.

                    Down payment options vary by loan type: Conventional (3-20%), FHA (3.5%), VA (0%), USDA (0%), Jumbo (15-20%). Lower down payments require PMI. If you can't afford 20% down, FHA or USDA might be better options. The key is balancing your down payment with your monthly budget and long-term goals.

                    Refinancing makes sense if you can save money over time. Use our refinance calculator to see your breakeven point. Generally, if the new rate is at least 1% lower and you plan to keep the home 2+ years, refinancing is worth considering. However, factors like credit score, equity, and closing costs affect the decision. Adam can provide detailed refinance analysis.

                    PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance) protects the lender if you default. It's required when your down payment is less than 20%. Cost varies by credit score and down payment amount (typically 0.55-1.86% annually). PMI ends when you have 20% equity. With a conventional loan, you can request PMI removal once you reach 20% equity through appreciation or principal reduction.
