          <h2>Rates Below 6% — What's Actually Happening</h2>

<p>Rates dropped below 6% this week. Not by much, but it's the first time we've seen it in months. The Fed's messaging has shifted. We're looking at multiple rate cuts coming this year — not right away, but they're coming.</p>

<p>Here's what this means for you: Your clients who've been waiting on the sidelines? They're going to start asking about it. And your clients in escrow? They're going to wonder if they should lock in or wait.</p>

<p>The smart play is having a clear answer ready. Rates at this level are worth a conversation with a lender who understands your pipeline. I can help you <a href="../calculators.html">run scenarios</a> so you're not guessing.</p>

<h2>Where Rate Cuts Go From Here</h2>

<p>Federal Reserve officials are publicly forecasting several more cuts in 2026. That's not "any week now" — but it's real momentum. This changes how you position financing conversations with buyers.</p>

<p>If a client is asking "Should we wait?" — you need actual numbers, not just optimism. A <a href="../prequal.html">pre-qualification</a> gives you something concrete to work with. You can show them: here's what they're approved for today, here's what it might look like in 90 days.</p>

<p>That's a conversation that moves deals, not stalls them.</p>

<h2>AI Tools for Realtors — Automation That Actually Works</h2>

<p>I've been deep into AI lately. Not ChatGPT for writing emails — I'm talking about tools that automate your whole workflow. I built my entire website with Claude, created backend automation for my newsletter, and I'm still finding new things it can do.</p>

<p>The reason I'm telling you this: most realtors are drowning in admin work that could be automated in a few hours. Your CRM data, your follow-ups, your market analysis — there are AI tools now that do this without you rebuilding your whole operation.</p>

<p>I tested the free version, moved to the $20 tier, and landed on the $100/month version. Worth every dollar. If you're managing multiple listings, multiple buyers, multiple timelines — you're doing work that software can handle.</p>

<p>Example: my wife was overwhelmed organizing summer camps across Austin — different neighborhoods, different costs, different dates. I spent maybe 30 minutes with an AI tool and built her an entire website to manage it. One prompt. Done.</p>

<p>That's the power we're talking about. Imagine that applied to your business.</p>

<h2>AI Certifications Are Becoming Standard</h2>

<p>Real estate organizations are already rolling out AI certifications. If you're not learning these tools now, you're behind. Not dramatically, but noticeably.</p>

<p>The agents who figure this out first will have a speed advantage. Faster responses. Better organized clients. Cleaner data. That compounds.</p>

<p>Start with one tool. Test it for a week. See what breaks and what saves you time. That's enough to know if it's worth your investment.</p>

<h2>How This Ties Together for Deal Flow</h2>

<p>Rates below 6% + AI automation = you can move faster than the agent next to you.</p>

<p>You respond to inquiries faster. You have numbers ready. You're organized. You're not fumbling through spreadsheets or waiting for callbacks.</p>

<p>Your clients feel it. Your lender feels it. Deals close.</p>

<p>If you want to dig into the current rate environment and talk about what these cuts mean for your pipeline, I'm here. We can <a href="../products.html">review loan programs</a> that fit your clients, or you can just grab 15 minutes to talk through what's realistic for your 2026 business.</p>

<h3>A Note From Adam</h3>

<p>I've recently discovered the power of Claude and it's been significant. I used to just use ChatGPT to occasionally help with emails and loan guidelines. Claude is like having 10 employees that are way smarter than I am. I started with the free version, moved to $20, and settled on the $100 version — no hesitation justifying the cost.</p>

<p>I built my entire website with it and I'm continuing to expand it with automations and SEO improvements. I've created backend tools that automate things like my newsletter. I keep thinking about how realtors would benefit from this, so I'm going to keep learning and start helping partners do the same.
