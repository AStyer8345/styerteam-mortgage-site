      <h2>Pre-Approval vs. Pre-Qualification</h2>
      <p>These terms are often used interchangeably, but they are very different in the eyes of sellers and listing agents:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pre-qualification</strong> is a quick estimate based on self-reported information. No documents are verified. It tells you roughly what you might afford but carries little weight with sellers.</li>
        <li><strong>Pre-approval</strong> involves a full review of your financial documents — income, assets, debts, and credit. The lender issues a letter confirming you are approved for a specific loan amount. In Austin's competitive market, this is what sellers and agents expect to see.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A strong pre-approval letter from a reputable local lender can be the difference between winning and losing a home in a multiple-offer situation.</p>

      <h2>Documents You Need for Pre-Approval</h2>
      <p>Gather these documents before you start to speed up the process:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Income:</strong> Last 2 pay stubs, 2 years of W-2s, 2 years of federal tax returns (all pages). Self-employed borrowers also need business tax returns and a year-to-date profit and loss statement.</li>
        <li><strong>Assets:</strong> Last 2 months of bank statements (all pages, all accounts), retirement account statements, investment account statements.</li>
        <li><strong>Identification:</strong> Valid driver's license or government-issued photo ID, Social Security number.</li>
        <li><strong>Housing history:</strong> Current landlord contact information or mortgage statement. If you own other properties, provide mortgage statements for each.</li>
        <li><strong>Other debt:</strong> Student loan statements, car loan statements, credit card statements if balances are significant.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Pre-Approval Process: Step by Step</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Submit your application</strong> — Complete the online application at your convenience. It takes about 15-20 minutes. <a href="https://mslp.my1003app.com/513013/register">Start here</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Upload documents</strong> — Securely upload the documents listed above through the portal.</li>
        <li><strong>Credit review</strong> — Your lender pulls your credit report and scores from all three bureaus.</li>
        <li><strong>Underwriter review</strong> — A preliminary review of your income, assets, and debts to determine your qualifying amount.</li>
        <li><strong>Pre-approval letter issued</strong> — You receive a letter stating the loan amount, loan type, and terms you are approved for.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The entire process typically takes 24-48 hours once all documents are submitted. In urgent situations, same-day pre-approvals are possible.</p>

      <h2>Why Pre-Approval Matters in Austin</h2>
      <p>Austin remains one of the most competitive housing markets in Texas. Desirable neighborhoods see multiple offers within days (sometimes hours) of listing. Here is why pre-approval gives you an edge:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Sellers take you seriously.</strong> A pre-approval letter proves you can close. Sellers and listing agents will often prioritize offers from pre-approved buyers over those without.</li>
        <li><strong>You know your budget.</strong> No more guessing. You know exactly what you qualify for, which loan program fits best, and what your estimated payment will be.</li>
        <li><strong>You can act fast.</strong> When you find the right home, you can submit an offer immediately without waiting for financing to be arranged.</li>
        <li><strong>Realtors work harder for pre-approved buyers.</strong> <a href="/realtors.html">Agents</a> know that pre-approved buyers are serious and closeable, so they invest more time finding you the right property.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How Long Is a Pre-Approval Valid?</h2>
      <p>Most pre-approval letters are valid for 60-90 days. After that, updated income and asset documentation may be needed to re-verify your financial situation. Your credit inquiry is valid for 120 days, so pulling a new report is not always necessary for a renewal.</p>
      <p>If you are not ready to buy immediately, getting pre-approved early still makes sense — it identifies any issues (credit, documentation, DTI) that you can address before you start house hunting.</p>

      <h2>Does Pre-Approval Affect Your Credit Score?</h2>
      <p>A pre-approval requires a hard credit inquiry, which typically lowers your score by 2-5 points. However, the credit bureaus treat all mortgage inquiries within a 14-45 day window as a single inquiry, so shopping multiple lenders during that period does not cause additional damage.</p>
      <p>The minor score impact is temporary (usually recovers within 1-2 months) and is far outweighed by the benefit of knowing your exact buying power.</p>

      <h2>Common Pre-Approval Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Making large purchases before closing.</strong> Buying a car, furniture, or appliances before your mortgage closes can change your DTI and jeopardize your approval.</li>
        <li><strong>Changing jobs.</strong> Lenders verify employment right before closing. Changing jobs can delay or derail your loan, especially if you switch industries or go from salary to commission.</li>
        <li><strong>Moving money between accounts.</strong> Large, unexplained transfers trigger questions during underwriting. Keep your money where it is and document any transfers that are necessary.</li>
        <li><strong>Opening or closing credit accounts.</strong> New credit applications and closed accounts both affect your score and credit profile. Hold off until after closing.</li>
        <li><strong>Co-signing for someone else.</strong> A co-signed loan shows up as your debt, increasing your DTI and potentially reducing your buying power.</li>
      </ul>
